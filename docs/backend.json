    "reasoning": "Given the simple nature of the application, where users generate PDFs and potentially share them, a straightforward structure is proposed. Since there's no collaborative aspect or user-specific data beyond generated PDFs, we'll store the PDFs directly under a top-level collection.  This design prioritizes simplicity.  \n\n**Authorization Independence:** Authorization rules will likely revolve around rate limiting or preventing abuse, which can be handled without complex data dependencies.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** Since all documents in `/pdf_documents` will have the same security posture (e.g., accessible via a temporary download link), QAPs are supported by ensuring structural segregation. If user-specific PDFs with different access controls were needed, we'd use a structure like `/users/{userId}/pdfs/{pdfId}`.\n"
